# Udibook


## About Udibook

Udibook is an application where you can listen to pre-installed audio books. It offers you audiobooks that interest you, suitable for the categories you choose, and saves you time in searching. It is very simple to use and you only need to create an account and select the categories you want to appear in front of you.

The purpose of developing this project was to show my skills in React Native, to show my 3rd party usage skills and to build a user-friendly application.
